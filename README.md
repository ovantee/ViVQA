# ViVQA: Vietnamese Question Answering Dataset
## General Introduction
Visual question answering (VQA) is a topic of great interest that has attracted the attention of researchers from fields such as natural language processing and computer vision in recent years. Although many VQA datasets and models have been primarily studied in English, there are no related works in Vietnamese VQA. In this article, we have created ViVQA, a new dataset for Vietnamese Visual Question Answering consisting of 5,000 images and 15,000 question-answer pairs in Vietnamese for evaluating Vietnamese VQA models. In addition, we propose a system using Hierarchical Co-Attention Model on the ViQA dataset achieving the Accuracy, WUPS 0.9, and WUPS 0.0, of 0.3496, 0.4513, and 0.7786, respectively. Our system outperforms the two baseline models (LSTM and BiLSTM) on the ViQA dataset. These results are positive to promote the development of Vietnamese visual question answering systems. Finally, we discuss possible future directions for ViVQA models to improve the performances.
